# ALICEIDLE
A simple discord bot developed for the purposes of improving my skill with C#.

Not developed with ease of setup in mind.
If you did want to compile and run this yourself, you'd need an SQL database containing the rows and columns referenced in the code found in the SqlDBHandler.cs file.
